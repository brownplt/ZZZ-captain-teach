[] Marks for function activities
  - track beginning/end of header/check blocks

   let the context figure it out (cmdline.rkt, repl.js, etc.), rather
   than printing by itself
[] Make CodeMirror behave with respect to zooming

[] Figure out how pathrefs should be created in the database... so
that caching can work (right now, we create path refs many times)

[] Libraries
[] Versions
[] Reviews
[] Design recipe step

[] Remove every hardcoded localhost
[] Get names for users? (or find something other than their email for Git
   commits in the name field)
[] How will we show reviews that students did for one another in the grading
   interface?

[] Consistent on("event") vs .event()
