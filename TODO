Simple assignment test for summer students@
[] Pick assignment
[] Error reporting
[x] Check-results reporting
[] Pretty printing
[x] Review instructions / make them look nicer
[] Run button
[] Save button
[x] Submit button in better location
[x] Reviews button de-uglify
[] Tab closing for reviews (prioritize other reviews)
[x] Figure out proper above / below for widgets. Instructions should
    be above, but reviews should be below... An option

Deployment & Performance;
[] Report abuse for students on cross-feedback
[] Remove every hardcoded localhost
[] Encryption
[] Caching/torture testing for performance
[] Get names for users? (or find something other than their email for Git
   commits in the name field)
[] Figure out how pathrefs should be created in the database... so
that caching can work (right now, we create path refs many times)

Grading/Teacher view
[] How will we show reviews that students did for one another in the grading
   interface?
[] Don't try to save versions in teacher review mode when switching versions

Scribble:
[] Get instructions in flow with the assignment parts
[] Choosing identifier names?
[] To turn on/off or # reviews by part, change args[reviews] to be a
   dictionary of part->reviews count
[] Indicate reviewability of activity instances in markup
  - Indicate this by creating and passing args

UI/JS:
[] Prettier test output
[] Highlight error messages in output
[] Make CodeMirror behave with respect to zooming
[] Do something with scrolling at the bottom of the REPL
[] Pretty-printing in the REPL
[] Width of editor
[] Clearing REPL output
[] Auto-save:
  - blob stores the most recent version (if any)
  - on reload, the blob is authoritative if its version matches the path's most recent version
  - otherwise, the blob is discarded
[] Extend code-assignment builder to do versioning
  - and save intermediate code!
[] Copy to beginning of the file even with atomic

Curricular:
[] Sensible front-end on finding that the assigned reviews are completely
   missing
[] Group by user_id and take the first by time in assign_reviews

Refactoring
[] data-parts needs to become data-steps
[] Refactor save/submit/lookupResource to share more
[] Consistent on("event") vs .event()


[x] Refactor server_tests.js into draw and ui components
[x] Write code-assignment builder in ct.js that uses these
[x] See the reviews you got
[x] Design/write code-assignment scribble
[x] Hook up frontend to call submission on each part
[] Test finishing assignments --- something odd with {done:true} that may just
   be browser refresh problem
[x] Test submission and subsequent review lookup

[?] Refactor parts/steps to be a list of more descriptive objects

[x] Marks for function activities
  - track beginning/end of header/check blocks
[x] Locks for control of Whalesong printing
[x] Have check mode just return the data structure of check results and
   let the context figure it out (cmdline.rkt, repl.js, etc.), rather
   than printing by itself

[x] Column on submitted for how many have reviewed

[x] Libraries
[x] Versions
[x] Reviews
[~] Design recipe step

[x] Scrollability behavior of reviews pane
