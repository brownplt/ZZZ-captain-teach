ASAP
[] Don't depend on user-visible names when creating resource sections for scribble!
[x] 500 notification emails
[x] Open-response questions
[x] Confused about whether run did anything (for simple examples)
[] Repl scrolling is awful
[x] notify when reviews show up
[x] color for passing tests in fixed region doesn't show up until active
[x] <unprintable-expr> on pretty printer
[] Highlight the part you are reviewing
[] Highlight the part you are editing
[] Distinguish review vs. step buttons
[] Run button, title, and saving indicator should follow page down with scrolling
[] Buttons for reviews/feedback should have a gradient or other indicator of
   good/bad
[] = vs. is accident in test cases; do a parse-test before submission?
  - Well-formedness error with a URL for the explanation of construct
[x] Can someone get the same code to review twice?
[] Reviews need timestamps (any blob stuff needs timestamp)

Late sept
[] Focus interactions when things run
[] Clicking a review link should focus that review tab, not open a new one
[] Refreshing when in reviews doesn't focus review tabs, and doesn't move
   editor to the right step
[] Tutorial
  - better description of what you should do for append
  - make it clear that before running definitions, they aren't defined
  - explain
  - fold example gives away what it is doing
  - more cases examples - explain what List means, etc
  - different examples for CS019 (we're teaching sorting, so...)
[] Submit button got lost sometimes - highlight and delete?
[] Flow changes:
  [x] Variants done before checks in DD
  [] Variants go unreviewed (review after example data)

Feedback from 8/13:
[] Break button when you "run" sometimes doesn't break - just re-enables prompt
   - infinite loops with recursion wouldn't break for Eisenstat
[] Break button graphic needs work - maybe have it have text rather than just a
   stop sign
[] check-block-N identifiers in standalone check blocks are off (names for
   check blocks?)
[] submit button is still present in last section after refreshing (no-op on
   server, but weird that it's there)
[] Feature idea: clicking on past repl entries copies into prompt
[] Feature idea: an option to give up on examples that ask you to fix things, and have it
   filled in for you

[] Format / make pretty feedback recieved on reviews
[x] UI jump when submitting work and starting reviews
Candidates:
[] phrasing of values not equal in "is" (maybe "expected...")
[x] Plumb name of editor for sending to server, so parse errors aren't in program "run".
  - Needs careful choice of name

[] Highlight column/span information?
[] Instructions should tell you which run button to click early on
[] Spaces around operators
[] Return type annotation not introduced in tutorial
[] Better error message when extra ends are added
[x] Horizontal scrolling in editors is bad (hides e.g. Strongly Agree)
[x] Tim saw multiple copies of the same review/feedback in the same review panel
[] Summary on hidden instructions (next to "click to show")
[] Workflow hard to follow, needs more inline instructions (Eisenstat)
[] Block import statements (security)
[x] Catch "print arg" because Python/Ruby users might try that

Justin:
[] Make buttons look more like buttons
[] More instructions about which part of the editor is edit-able
[] Figure out this comment: 'Connor asked "should we see a 1 on the side?"
   after seeing only an arrow in the editor.'

Need To Do:
[] Review should have better feedback when you don't fill in values
[] Background on code in reviews, highlight whole lines
[] Error Messages
   - empty args for for loop is bizarre
   - Constructor form in messages
   - field not found
   - different parse errors, and bad:
     (add1 5)
     add1(add1 7)
   - binops - bad args to prim is a terrible message
   - can we eliminate [[code]] (at least name, or something)
   - forgetting to close a paren and forgetting an end have BAD parse errors
   - cases with no value
   - random error message is bad
   - cases with missing pipes is bad
[] Well formedness
   - ERRORS DONT HAVE SRCLOCS when run with raco pyret.
   - multiple expressions on the same line (should at least be error on repl)
[x] syntax for check-exn
[] Highlighting on errors should be removed
[] Progress is wierd - shouldn't fill when you are on the last step. Maybe use orange/blue?
[] Handling of unexpected racket errors (like unbound identifiers?)
[x] Indentation bugs:
   - except(e):
   - fun f():
     o.{o:x} # not indented
     end
[x] Filter payloads on inbox-for-write or partition data

Want To Do:
[] Doc string on builtins
[] Run this code on my code?
[] Indentation checker
[] Draw review blocks as code examples (so you can play with them and reset)

Not Necessary:
[] switch Enter and Shift-Enter?
[] should print nothing? *note*: we do if you call "print" - it is javascript
   that skips
[] Should we stub out functions so they pass type checking? / Should run only
   be shown for definition stages.
[] Tab at beginning of line with text should jump to beginning of text
[] Think about narrow screens

All Feedback:
[] Colors on everything
[] Look at ben's state (reloaded, he was put at first step)
[] Check for termination:
    doubled-numbers = for map(elt from [1, 2, 3]):
      elt * 2
    end
    print(doubled-numbers)

    sum-of-numbers = for fold(sum from 0, elt from [1, 2, 3]):
      sum + elt
    end
    print(sum-of-numbers)

    odd-numbers = for filter(number from list.range(1,1000000)):
      number.modulo(2) == 0
    end
    print(odd-numbers)


[] Review Interface / Design
   [x] Concrete rubric for reviews (data/tests/function different)
     [x] Get feedback from Kathi
     [] Rewrite first tests question
   [x] confidence for review?
    - No
   [x] Concern: "same as the last guy" for comments. Maybe don't close tabs until all reviews done?
    - No worries, bad feedback will catch this
   [x] Feedback for reviews:
     [x] Helpfulness likert + optional comments
     [x] Report abuse button
       - create a table for abuses:
         userReporting | abuseData
       - update drawReview for abuse
         - showReview's callers need to pass abuseData 
       - update drawSubmittedFeedback for abuse
       - update readOnlyEditorFromParts for abuse
   [x] Logging on reviews:
     [x] Count of times read
   [x] Place to see my reviews and feedback on them


Deployment & Performance;
[] More complete solution for signup/adding users
[] Caching/torture testing for performance
[] Get names for users? (or find something other than their email for Git
   commits in the name field)
[] Figure out how pathrefs should be created in the database... so
   that caching can work (right now, we create path refs many times)

Scribble:
[] Choosing identifier names?
  -  I don't know what this means

UI/JS:
[] Make CodeMirror behave with respect to zooming
[] Extend code-assignment builder to do versioning
  - and save intermediate code!
[] Copy to beginning of the file even with atomic
  - button for popping out just text

Curricular:
[] Sensible front-end on finding that the assigned reviews are completely
   missing

Refactoring
[] data-parts needs to become data-steps
[] Refactor save/submit/lookupResource to share more
[] Consistent on("event") vs .event()

[] Test finishing assignments --- something odd with {done:true} that may just
   be browser refresh problem


==================== DONE

[x] Group by user_id and take the first by time in assign_reviews
[x] Pre-seeded reviews
  [x] Two paths in assign_reviews, looking for canned solutions/or not
    - Should warn us with some urgent message if no canned
      solutions are available
  [x] inbox-for-write is aware (via private args), that immediate feedback
     needs to be created, and create appropriate feedback
  [x] client side of writeReview needs to check for feedback immediately,
     and:
      - wait to close until getting feedback
      - show immediate feedback if it is present

[x] Test submission and subsequent review lookup

[?] Refactor parts/steps to be a list of more descriptive objects

[x] Marks for function activities
  - track beginning/end of header/check blocks
[x] Locks for control of Whalesong printing
[x] Have check mode just return the data structure of check results and
   let the context figure it out (cmdline.rkt, repl.js, etc.), rather
   than printing by itself

[x] Column on submitted for how many have reviewed

[x] Libraries
[x] Versions
[x] Reviews
[~] Design recipe step

[x] Scrollability behavior of reviews pane
[x] Rewrite sorting.jrny to be an actual tutorial
   x change green to pass in copy
   x s/builtin/builtins/
   x introduce data, before cases
   X instructions for Shift-Enter too late
   x Object literals? Should come later, bring up data first (or SKIP)
   x minus on lists implied by instructions
   x functional object update syntax is confusing (introduce later?)
   x symmetric syntax of for is confusing for fold (why does accumulator have to be where it is?)
   x data versus data type. consistent style / vocabulary.
   x use identifiers that are NOT the fields in cases
   x append as identifier
   x append needs to be described - what should it do?
   x interactions should come earlier
   x if they are to use random for pivot, should introduce list.get
   X check as identifier
   X disallow `is` outside check
   X unbound identifiers (env with builtins needed)
[x] If error is already on the screen, don't scroll to it, when clicking on
   location information
[x] If all tests pass, show that. maybe highlight in editor, and just print
   summary in interactions

   - `is` could thunk stuff
[x] Disable repl prompt when running
[x] Paren matching in editor. end matching... would be cool
[x] string missing lessequal, greaterequal
[x] Submit needs lots of confirmation

[x] tostring methods aren't preserved over method partial applications

[x] Pretty-printing in the REPL
[x] Width of editor
[x] Clearing REPL output
[x] Auto-save:
  Don't do the below; simpler solution, just Git version everything

   - doesn't exist anymore

[x] grammar reference! maybe tooltip on keywords?
