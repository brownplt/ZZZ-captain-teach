[x] Marks for function activities
  - track beginning/end of header/check blocks
[x] Locks for control of Whalesong printing
[x] Have check mode just return the data structure of check results and
   let the context figure it out (cmdline.rkt, repl.js, etc.), rather
   than printing by itself
[] Prettier test output
[] Highlight error messages in output
[] Make CodeMirror behave with respect to zooming

[] Column on submitted for how many have reviewed

[] Simple assignment test for summer students@

[] Group by user_id and take the first by time in assign_reviews

[] Figure out how pathrefs should be created in the database... so
that caching can work (right now, we create path refs many times)

[x] Libraries
[x] Versions
[] Reviews
[] Design recipe step

[] Remove every hardcoded localhost
[] Get names for users? (or find something other than their email for Git
   commits in the name field)
[] How will we show reviews that students did for one another in the grading
   interface?

[] Consistent on("event") vs .event()

[] Don't try to save versions in teacher review mode when switching versions

[] Indicate reviewability of activity instances in markup
  - Indicate this by creating and passing args

[] Auto-save:
  - blob stores the most recent version (if any)
  - on reload, the blob is authoritative if its version matches the path's most recent version
  - otherwise, the blob is discarded

[] Refactor server_tests.js into draw and ui components
[] Write code-assignment builder in ct.js that uses these
[] Design/write code-assignment scribble
[] TEST TEST TEST
