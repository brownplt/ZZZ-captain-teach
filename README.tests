Tests and experiments can be written in several places.

RSpec

  There are rspec unit tests for the controllers, models, and git wrapper in
  web/spec/.  These can be run with guard.

  $ guard

UI

  Some JQuery-driven user interface tests are served (in development and test
  modes) from <root>/tests/.  They run with Jasmine and the tests are in
  JavaScript files in web/app/assets/javascripts/spec/

Manual tests

  We have experimental tests in other places that are less automated but still
  useful.  Serving <root>/swatches shows several UI elements on the same page
  with testable interactions.  This is a place to load elements and play with
  them to see if they can be forced into odd states, still work with one
  another, etc.

  There are also manual tests in test_controller, currently served from
  server_tests, which are served from <root>/server_tests.  These tests
  currently take a "user" parameter of any string, using the same parameter
  will load the same users and any stored data, using a not-seen-before
  parameter will restart the interaction.  The point of this test is to do
  reviews and see that they worked.
